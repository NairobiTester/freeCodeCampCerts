  /**
The ::before selector creates a pseudo-element which is the first child of the selected element, while the ::after 
selector creates a pseudo-element which is the last child of the selected element. These pseudo-elements are often 
used to create cosmetic content, which you will see later in this project.

For now, create a CSS selector to target all elements with *, and include the pseudo-elements with ::before and ::after. 
Set the box-sizing property to inherit.

*, ::before, ::after {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}

Using pseudo-selectors. To create the black keys, add a new .key.black--key::after selector. This will target the 
elements with the class key black--key, and select the pseudo-element after these elements in the HTML.

In the new selector, set the background-color to #1d1e22. Also set the content property to "". This will make the 
pseudo-elements empty.

The content property is used to set or override the content of the element. By default, the pseudo-elements created 
by the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors are empty, and the elements will not be rendered to the page. Setting 
the content property to an empty string "" will ensure the element is rendered to the page while still being empty.

If you would like to experiment, try removing the background-color property and setting different values for the 
content property, such as "♥". Remember to undo these changes when you are done so the tests pass.

.key.black--key::after {
  background-color: #1d1e22;
  content: "";
